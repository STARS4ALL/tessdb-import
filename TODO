* period 1D Histogram plot --bin=<N>
* Sequence Difference, Time difference 2D histogram plot --bin=<N>
* period vs Time to see gaps and bumps



MODULE STATS


* retained detection with the following query

SELECT (r.date_id || 'T' || r.time_id || 'Z') as tstamp, r.tess, r.sequence_number, r.frequency, r.magnitude, r.ambient_temperature, r.sky_temperature, r.signal_strength, r.rank
FROM raw_readings_t AS r
JOIN first_differences_t AS d
WHERE r.tess    == d.tess
AND   r.date_id == d.date_id
AND   r.time_id == d.time_id
AND   d.seq_diff > 1
AND   d.seconds_diff < :period
AND   r.tess == :name
ORDER BY tstamp ASC;

* Display previous reading to detected retained and also display the rejection status. 
Maybe it has been marked as a Duplicated Seq. Number
